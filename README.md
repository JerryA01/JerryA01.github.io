This is a responsive book store website which can be accessed on any device. Including the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and API's. Use of HTML and CSS to customise the pages. Use of JavaScript to validate the user's bank details and show the last four digits of the users bank details if validated. The way i have used API's here is by sending a POST request to a server. In this case its the customers bank details. It then showcases and stores that on the server.
