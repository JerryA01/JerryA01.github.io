This is a book store website which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Including the use of API's. Use of HTML and CSS to customise the pages. Use of JavaScript to validate the user input. The way i have used API's here is by sending a POST request to a server. In this case its the customers bank details. It then showcases and stores that on the server.
